# aBPA: ancient Bacterial Pangenome Analysis

ancient Bacterial Pangenome Analysis is a `nextflow` package.

### Installation
First you need to have `nextflow` installed. Please visit: https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html and follow the instructions.


After installing `nextflow`, if you wish to be able to call the executable without explicitly define the full PATH please do:

Open your bashrc file:
nano .bashrc

Then add this line at the end: ###Note that the PATH will be unique in your system. In my case I installed nextflow in the folder /Softwares/Nextflow.
`export PATH=$PATH:/home/users/myuser/Softwares/Nextflow`
